# Litmatch-Clone-SwiftUI

Litmatch Clone is a SwiftUI Firebase portfolio project I was build to implement what I was learn about basic and intermediate iOS Development Skill.

I use Swiftui because it’s more less code writing and making it easier to test and debug my code
And I’m using Firebase because it’s easy to installation and use, firebase also provide some feature I needed to build this app such as, Authentication for user login, Firebase Firestore to storing any user data and User Chat, Firebase Strorage to storing image and Video post.

My motivation to build this app is to learn and practicing swift in iOS App Development. like creating UI and backend service which I choose Firebase to make user registration, real time chat, social media post, and user settings (Upcoming)

I’m build this app because I’m also litmatch user and I have interested to create similar app. Because this app have beautiful design and very simple registration process.

This app still in development, for now available feature only sign in using google, and facebook.

## ** What I have learned from build this project:
•	I have been practicing the basics of the Swift programming language which I have learned from Udemy courses and YouTube tutorials.
•	I learn more about SwiftUI to create UI app such as layouting, put and resizing image, creating custom button with image and text.
•	I’m also learning how to use third package dependency which is Firebase. I learn how to install and using it for user registration.
